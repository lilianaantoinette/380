                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Close Reading Paper</h4>
                    <p>This 1250-1500 word analytical essay focuses on the close reading of a single primary text from the course. You will advance an arguable thesis supported by evidence from the text itself. If you would like to improve your score on this assignment, you may revise and resubmit it after final grades are posted. Resubmissions should include a 300-word revision statement.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Annotated Bibliography</h4>
                    <p>You will compile an annotated bibliography of at least six credible academic sources relevant to your final paper topic. For each source, you will provide a correct MLA citation and a concise annotation that summarizes its argument, evaluates its methodology, and reflects on its utility for your research. This task develops your ability to locate, evaluate, and synthesize scholarly sources.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Attendance and Participation</h4>
                    <p>Your engaged presence is essential in this discussion-based seminar. This grade reflects the quality and consistency of your contribution to our collective learning environment. You are expected to arrive prepared, having critically read the assigned texts, and to participate actively and respectfully in all synchronous and asynchronous course activities. Your attendance and participation scores are weighted evenly across this category, and your participation grade is the average score taken from self and peer group evaluations completed at the end of the semester.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Conference Presentation</h4>
                    <p>You will deliver a 5-7 minute conference-style presentation based on your final research paper, followed by a brief Q&A. This assignment translates written scholarship into oral communication, requiring you to distill your argument for a live audience using a visual aid.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Quizzes</h4>
                    <p>Weekly quizzes are given to encourage consistent engagement with course material and to provide regular opportunities for you to check your understanding. They exist to build the foundations you'll need to complete your larger projects confidently. These low-stakes assessments are open-note (but not open-computer) and may be retaken to improve your score. They will be given at the beginning of class using pen and paper. If you miss a quiz or would like to retake one, it is your responsibility to let me know so we can arrange a makeup/retake.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Response Papers</h4>
                    <p>This series of six short writing assignments provides sequenced practice in core methodologies of literary scholarship. These low-stakes exercises are designed to build the foundational skills necessary for your major papers and informed class discussion. Your grade will be based on engagement and completion.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Theoretical Paper (Final Paper)</h4>
                    <p>This 2500-3000 word research paper is the capstone project of this course. You will develop an original argument about one or more primary texts using a specific theoretical or critical lens, supported by engagement with at least six scholarly sources. The paper demonstrates your ability to synthesize close reading with scholarly research and contribute to an ongoing academic conversation. Due to end-of-semester grading deadlines, there will not be an opportunity to revise and resubmit this paper after the deadline.</p>

                    <h3>Attendance</h3>
                    <p>More than two unexcused absences (equivalent to one week of class) will lower a student's final grade. More than six unexcused absences will result in a 0 in the attendance and participation category.</p>
                    <p><strong>Excused absences</strong> include: illness or injury to the student; death, injury, or serious illness of an immediate family member; religious reasons (California Education Code section 89320); jury duty or government obligation; university sanctioned or approved activities.</p>
                    <p>If you know you will miss class for any of these reasons, please let me know as soon as possible. If something comes up that you could not have anticipated, please email or speak to me about the reason for the absence when you can.</p>

                    <h3>Late Work</h3>
                    <p>Assignments are due at 11:59PM on the indicated date unless otherwise noted. Late submissions incur penalties:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Less than 1 hour late: 5% deduction</li>
                        <li>Less than 24 hours late: 10% deduction</li>
                        <li>Less than one week late: 20% deduction</li>
                        <li>Assignments submitted more than one week late may receive a maximum grade of 50%</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you are having technical difficulties, email me your paper to show that it was done on time and submit exactly the same version to Canvas when you are able to.</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>"Life Happens" Extension</h3>
                    <p>Once during the semester, each student may use one 48-hour extension without discussing it with me first. You do not need to provide a reason for the extension‚Äîjust send me an email to let me know you would like to use it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Because of end-of-semester grading deadlines, the extension cannot be used on your final essay.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
                    <p>Plagiarism, self-plagiarism, or unauthorized use of generative AI will result in a zero and possible course failure. Limited AI use for minor tasks is acceptable but must be cited. All submissions checked through Turnitin.</p>
                    <p><strong>AI Policy:</strong> Using GenAI tools to generate content is not allowed on any assignment. Submitting AI-generated work as if it were your own is a form of academic dishonesty. All submitted work will be screened using multiple AI detection tools, including TurnItIn, and you will be required to submit version history as part of your grade for any assignment that is not handwritten.</p>
                    <p>This policy includes tools like Grammarly when their use goes beyond basic spellcheck to generate or substantially alter language.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Classroom Conduct</h3>
                    <p>Respectful discussion is encouraged. Avoid inflammatory language related to gender, sexual orientation, age, race, culture, or religion. Disrespectful behavior will not be tolerated.</p>
                    <p>Showing consideration for your classmates and your instructor includes silencing your cell phones and any other disruptive electronic devices. I may tell you to leave the classroom if you scroll, talk over other students, etc. If you are asked to leave for conduct reasons, you will be marked absent.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Communication Policy</h3>
                    <p>I will do my best to respond to emails within 24 hours Monday-Friday from 9-5. While I will keep an eye on my emails over the weekend, I cannot guarantee an immediate response.</p>
                    <p>If more than 24 hours goes by during the week and you have not heard back from me via email or in class, please feel free to follow up!</p>
                    <p>Make sure to turn on your Canvas notifications so you receive any announcements or messages from me.</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Technology Policy</h3>
                    <p>Students may use laptops (or other electronic devices) for taking notes and reading course materials. Please do not distract yourself or your classmates with non-course related browsing; you'll get more out of the class if you pay attention and participate.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>University Withdrawal Policy</h3>
                    <p>Class withdrawals during the final three weeks of instruction are not permitted except for a very serious and compelling reason such as accident or serious injury that is clearly beyond the student's control.</p>
                    <p>Application for withdrawal from CSULB or from a class must be officially filed by the student with Enrollment Services whether the student has ever attended the class or not; otherwise, the student will receive a grade of "WU" (unauthorized withdrawal) in the course.</p>

Your choice to permit this is completely optional and will not affect your grade. If you would prefer that I do not use your work as an example in future classes, please let me know in an email.</p>
